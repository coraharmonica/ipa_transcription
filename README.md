# lexigram
Lexigram produces graphs and diagrams for representing linguistic features, including morphemes and IPA pronunciations.

Initialize a MorphemeParser in your desired language to generate lists of common words as well as their morphemes and IPA transcriptions.  Refer to demo.py to see examples of how to visualize data.
